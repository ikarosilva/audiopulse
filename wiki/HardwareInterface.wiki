#summary Instructions and notes for hardware interface

This page will be updated with more organized details and diagrams.

= Technical requirements =
Describe phone input / output, ER10C input/output characteristics
==ER10C specifications==
===Input===
1kHz sensitivity: 72 dB SPL = 1V RMS
Output Z = 50 kOhm

===Output===
0 dB SPL = 0 dBuV
Output Z = 100 Ohm

==Example phone I/O specifications==
Input Z ~= 1 kOhm
Max input voltage ~= 500 mV PP
Output Z ~= 50 Ohm
Output Voltage = 1 V PP

= Simple passive interface =

A simple analog connection can be built using a few commercially-available cables and 1 added capacitor for DC-voltage blocking.

Use a 1 uF cap for < 100 Hz high-pass cutoff, inserted into microphone path

Describe possible modifications to phone gain arrays, etc. for improved dynamic range

= Passive filter interface =

E.g., notch filter for input stimulus frequencies, allowing more analog gain prior to phone ADC input

= ADC-DAC stage interface =

An ADC stage prior to phone to allow our own specs
