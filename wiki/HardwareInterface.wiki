#summary Instructions and notes for hardware interface

= Technical requirements =

Describe phone input / output, ER10C input/output characteristics

= Simple passive interface =

Describe cable with passive components

Describe possible modifications to phone gain arrays, etc. for improved dynamic range

= Passive filter interface =

E.g., notch filter for input stimulus frequencies, allowing more analog gain prior to phone ADC input

= ADC-DAC stage interface =

An ADC stage prior to phone to allow our own specs
